# kaggle-notebooks

## What is this?

This repository contains [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) that I created or worked on as part of some activity related to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), a platform for data science and machine learning.

As Kaggle hosts competitions that are splendid opportunities for honing skills in data science and machine learning (as participants get to build models and submit predictions from provided datasets, and compare results on leaderboards), a lot of the notebooks found here will likely be related to a Kaggle competition. As I work iteratively on the models, I tend to rely on Kaggle's GitHub integration and save a version of the work at certain points (e.g. when submitting a prediction to the competition) to keep track of my progress.

The Jupyter notebooks, which can be identified by the `.ipynb` extension at the end of their file names, cannot (at this moment) be directly run on GitHub's interface, but GitHub does have support to automatically render them quite nicely in most cases.

### Competitions

- ["Predict the Introverts from the Extroverts"](competitions/playground-series-s5e7/) competition
    - This was my first competition! I was only able to join it later and so I only had 3 days (out of the 1 month period the competition was held) to work on it, but although I did not get into the top 10 of the private [leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e7/leaderboard) (nor was I close to it), it was exciting to examine the data and build models to submit predictions.
    - I was wary from the start about overfitting to the public leaderboard, but it seems I still have much to learn (my private leaderboard ranking was 364 lower than the one for the public leaderboard).
- and more to come!
