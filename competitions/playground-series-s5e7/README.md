# "Predict the Introverts from the Extroverts" competition

Files related to the "Predict the Introverts from the Extroverts" Kaggle competition ([playground-series-s5e7](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e7)) can be found here.

In particular, [predicting-introverts-from-extroverts.ipynb](predicting-introverts-from-extroverts.ipynb) is the Jupyter Notebook that I created to build models and submit predictions for the competition.

I'll add more details here soon about my approach, what seemed to have went well, and what didn't.
