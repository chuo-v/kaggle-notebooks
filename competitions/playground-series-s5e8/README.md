# "Binary Classification with a Bank Dataset" competition

Files related to the "Binary Classification with a Bank Dataset" Kaggle competition ([playground-series-s5e8](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e8)) can be found here.

In particular, the following are Jupyter Notebooks that I created to build models and submit predictions for the competition. More details and accompanying explanations can be found there.
1. [binary-classification-with-a-bank-dataset.ipynb](binary-classification-with-a-bank-dataset.ipynb) (_traditional machine learning techniques_)
2. [binary-classification-with-a-bank-dataset-pytorch.ipynb](binary-classification-with-a-bank-dataset-pytorch.ipynb) (_neural network_)

I initially worked on the first notebook where I experimented with traditional machine learning techniques; later on, I started working on the second notebook where I trained my first neural network, and started seeing better results.

As I already did most of the data exploration and preprocessing when working on the first notebook, I was a bit more selective in only including in the second notebook content that is more relevant to the training of the neural network.
